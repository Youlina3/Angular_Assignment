# Angular_Assignment
This is for assignments of Angular online course.

Assignment 1: Practicing Components Create two new Components (manually or with CLI): WarningAlert and SuccessAlert Output them beneath each other in the AppComponent Output a warning or success message in the Components Style the Components appropriately (maybe some red/ green text?) Use external or internal templates and styles!

Assignment 2: Practicing databindings Add a Input field which updates a property ('username') via Two-Way-Binding Output the username property via String Interpolation (in a paragraph below the input) Add a button which may only be clicked if the username is NOT an empty string Upon clicking the button, the username should be reset to an empty string

Assignment 3: Practice about Directives and use the most common Directives.Add A button which says 'Display Details'. Add a paragraph with any content of your choice (e.g. 'Secret Password = tuna')Toggle the displaying of that paragraph with the button created in the first step.Log all button clicks in an array and output that array below the secret paragraph (maybe log a timestamp or simply an incrementing number). Starting at the 5th log item, give all future log items a blue background (via ngStyle) and white color (ngClass)
